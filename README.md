## Usage
The application prompts the user with questions in the terminal. The user can choose to add teammates of Intern or Engineer after
a Manager has first been entered. Each type of team member has slightly different inputs. Once the user chooses not to add anymore teammates,
the application writes the HTML file into the 'dist' folder.
